</ul>

<h2>
BIOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS</h2>
<p>Now a days we see that there is vast growth in field of biology such as genomics, proteomics, functional Genomics and biomedical research.Biological data mining is very important part of Bioinformatics. Following are the aspects in which Data mining contribute for biological data analysis:</p>
<ul><li>

Semantic integration of heterogeneous , distributed genomic and proteomic databases.</li><li>

Alignment, indexing , similarity search and comparative analysis multiple nucleotide sequences.</li><li>

Discovery of structural patterns and analysis of genetic networks and protein pathways.</li><li>

Association and path analysis.</li><li>

Visualization tools in genetic data analysis.</li></ul>

<h2>OTHER SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>The applications discussed above tend to handle relatively small and homogeneous data sets for which the statistical techniques are appropriate. Huge amount of data have been collected from scientific domains such as geosciences, astronomy etc. There is large amount of data sets being generated because of the fast numerical simulations in various fields such as climate, and ecosystem modeling, chemical engineering, fluid dynamics etc. Following are the applications of data mining in field of Scientific Applications:</p>
<ul><li>
Data Warehouses and data preprocessing.</li><li>

Graph-based mining.</li><li>

Visualization and domain specific knowledge.</li></ul>
<h2>INTRUSION DETECTION</h2>

<p>Intrusion refers to any kind of action that threatens integrity, confidentiality, or availability of network resources. In this world of connectivity security has become the major issue. With increased usage of internet and availability of tools and tricks for intruding and attacking network prompted intrusion detection to become a critical component of network administration. Here is the list of areas in which data mining technology may be applied for intrusion detection:</p>
<ul><li>
Development of data mining algorithm for intrusion detection.</li><li>

Association and correlation analysis, aggregation to help select and build discriminating attributes.</li><li>

Analysis of Stream data.</li><li>

Distributed data mining.</li><li>

Visualization and query tools.</li></ul>

<h2>Data Mining System Products</h2>
<p>There are many data mining system products and domain specific data mining applications are available. The new data mining systems and applications are being added to the previous systems. Also the efforts are being made towards standardization of data mining languages.</p>

<h2>Choosing Data Mining System</h2>
<p>Which data mining system to choose will depend on following features of Data Mining System:</p>

<ul><li>Data Types - The data mining system may handle formatted text, record-based data and relational data. The data could also be in ASCII text, relational database data or data warehouse data. Therefore we should check what exact format, the data mining system can handle.</li><li>

System Issues - We must consider the compatibility of Data Mining system with different operating systems. One data mining system may run on only on one operating system or on several. There are also data mining systems that provide web-based user interfaces and allow XML data as input.</li><li>

Data Sources - Data Sources refers to the data formats in which data mining system will operate. Some data mining system may work only on ASCII text files while other on multiple relational sources. Data mining system should also support ODBC connections or OLE DB for ODBC connections.</li><li>

Data Mining functions and methodologies - There are some data mining systems that provide only one data mining function such as classification while some provides multiple data mining functions such as concept description, discovery-driven OLAP analysis, association mining, linkage analysis, statistical analysis, classification, prediction, clustering, outlier analysis, similarity search etc.</li></ul>

<p>Coupling data mining with databases or data warehouse systems - Data mining system need to be coupled with database or the data warehouse systems. The coupled components are integrated into a uniform information processing environment.Here are the types of coupling listed below:</p>

<ul><li>No coupling</li><li>

Loose Coupling</li><li>

Semi tight Coupling</li><li>

Tight Coupling</li></ul>

<p>Scalability - There are two scalability issues in Data Mining as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Row (Database size) Scalability - Data mining System is considered as row scalable when the number or rows are enlarged 10 times, It takes no more than the 10 times to execute the query.</li><li>

Column (Dimension) Salability - Data mining system is considered as column scalable if the mining query execution time increases linearly with number of columns.</li></ul>

<p>Visualization Tools - Visualization in Data mining can be categorized as follows:</p>
<ul><li>
Data Visualization</li><li>

Mining Results Visualization</li><li>

Mining process visualization</li><li>

Visual data mining</li><li>

Data Mining query language and graphical user interface - The graphical user interface which is easy to use and is required to promote user guided, interactive data mining. Unlike relational database systems data mining systems do not share underlying data mining query language.</li></ul>

<h2>Trends in Data Mining</h2>
<p>Here is the list of trends in data mining that reflects pursuit of the challenges such as construction of integrated and interactive data mining environments, design of data mining languages:</p>

<ul><li>Application Exploration</li><li>

Scalable and Interactive data mining methods</li><li>

Integration of data mining with database systems, data warehouse systems and web database systems.</li><li>

Standardization of data mining query language</li><li>

Visual Data Mining</li><li>

New methods for mining complex types of data</li><li>
